### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am currently a postdoctoral fellow in Computational Neurosciences at the Department of [Brain and Behavioral Sciences](https://dbbs.dip.unipv.it/) at the University of Pavia, Italy.  
My field of expertise is the creation of workflows for the reconstruction, simulation and refinement of point-neuron brain models from biological data.
I also develop methods to build atlas-based models of the mouse brain.  

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on: the [Brain Scaffold Builder suite](https://github.com/dbbs-lab/bsb) which is a component framework for neural modelling and simulating brain models  
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: Mouse cell composition and atlases
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: I cannot resist the dopamine effect of GitHub notifications 
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
- âš¡ Fun fact: Memory performance is closely linked to interest, which can be aroused by fun facts. [Fastrich, Greta M., et al. (2018)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/mot0000087).
